* R [@R] is an implementation of the S programming language, which was created in 1976 by **[John Chambers](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_(statistician))** while at Bell Labs. 

* R itself was created by **[Ross Ihaka](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka)** and **[Robert Gentleman](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician))** at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. First release in 1995.

* Currently developed by the **[R Development Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)**, of which Chambers is a member. 

<!-- R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. -->

*   Know about the Regular Expressions? `??"Regular Expressions"`, or `help.search("Regular Expressions")`

*   Look at more in deph information about the Matrix package? `vignette(package="Matrix")`
